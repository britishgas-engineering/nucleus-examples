        <h4 slot="heading">What happens to my renewal price after the first year?</h4>
        <p>
          The price you始ll pay at renewal is likely to increase as your introductory price will have ended, but it will be tailored to your specific details.
          If you始re paying by direct debit, you will automatically renew, however you can still choose to change or cancel your contract, we'll contact you before your renewal date to remind you.
